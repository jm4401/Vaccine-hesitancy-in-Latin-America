Before running the code, create a folder titled "Tables and Figures" in the directory to save all the necessary outputs.

* 00_table_function.R is an extra script that is used to create many of the tables in the supplementary information
* 01_MainText.R replicates the figures in the main text
* 02_SupplementaryInformation.R replicates the tables in the supplementary information. Note that some formatting changes to match the tables in the .pdf exactly will have to be made, but the "values" will all match, with a few exceptions (e.g., information that is external to the survey data we collected such as Census numbers for descriptive statistics)
* Stata code for bounding exercises.do replicates Supplementary Tables 13-14
